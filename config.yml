  # As later versions might introduce new checks that prevent builds from succeeding,
  # we will use the -checks flag with check negation to exclude problematic checks.
  # The basic configuration for staticcheck already excludes certain checks, so we'll
  # mimic that behaviour here:
  #   ST1000: Incorrect or missing package comment
  #   ST1003: Poorly chosen identifier
  #   ST1016: Use consistent method receiver names
  #   ST1020: The documentation of an exported function should start with the function's name
  #   ST1021: The documentation of an exported type should start with type's name
  #   ST1022: The documentation of an exported variable or constant should start with variable's name
  #   ST1023: Redundant type in variable declaration
  # -----
  # Any additional excluded checks should be detailed here
